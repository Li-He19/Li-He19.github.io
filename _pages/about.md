<!-- # About Me -->

Hello! My name is **Li He**, and I am a Master‚Äôs student in **Computer Science** at the **University of Victoria**.

My research interests include **machine learning**, **distributed systems**, and **computer networks**.  
I enjoy working on projects that connect *AI* with large-scale system design, such as analyzing and optimizing traffic patterns in distributed deep learning.

Before my graduate studies, I completed coursework and projects in **algorithms**, **optimization for machine learning**, and **computer communication networks**, earning top grades in all courses.

Beyond academics, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects and collaborations.  

<!-- üëâ Check out my [projects](projects.md) and [CV](cv.pdf) for more details. -->


Work Experience
======
**Software Developer (Part-time)**  
Pigeon Communication Limited, Victoria, BC, Canada  
*2020 ‚Äì 2021*  
- Programmed and deployed C-based firmware for Arduino Uno microcontrollers to control experimental hardware.  
- Configured and operated UAVs for field experiments, contributing to data collection and system validation.  

**Postal Clerk**  
Canada Post, Victoria, BC, Canada  
*2021 ‚Äì 2024*  
- Processed and sorted high-volume mail and packages in a time-sensitive, team-based environment.  
- Ensured accuracy and efficiency while supporting daily operations under tight deadlines.  

Selected Project Experience
======

1. **Traffic Pattern Analysis and Comparison of Distributed Deep Learning Models**  
   *Technologies: PyTorch (DistributedDataParallel), ASTRA-sim, Slurm, NVIDIA DGX-2, Google TPU*  
   - Architected and executed distributed training experiments for models like VGG16 and GPT-3 on Canada‚Äôs Alliance HPC clusters, achieving 91% model accuracy with minimal communication overhead.  
   - Utilized ASTRA-sim to model and analyze training performance across various network topologies, identifying fully connected layers as the primary communication bottleneck.  

2. **Large-Scale Text Embeddings & Clustering Using Metadata and Pinecone Embeddings**  
   *Technologies: Python, Pinecone, Sentence Transformers, Scikit-learn (PCA, K-Means), KeyBERT*  
   - Built a semantic search pipeline by generating high-dimensional embeddings from a large text corpus using Sentence Transformers and the Pinecone vector database.  
   - Implemented PCA for dimensionality reduction and leveraged KeyBERT for automated keyword extraction to enrich metadata.  
   - Deployed K-Means clustering to group related documents, significantly improving search result relevance and speed for text-based applications.  

3. **Analysis of RED Algorithm Using Markov Chain Model**  
   *Technologies: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Computer Networking, Performance Modeling, Markov Chains*  
   - Developed a Markov Chain model to simulate and analyze the queueing behavior of the Random Early Detection (RED) congestion control algorithm.  
   - Conducted a comparative performance analysis of Linear vs. Exponential RED, visualizing the results with Matplotlib.  
   - Demonstrated that Exponential RED achieves significantly higher throughput and lower packet latency under simulated network congestion.  

4. **Analysis and Prediction of Maternal Health Risk**  
   *Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn (SGD, Random Forest), TensorFlow, Pandas*  
   - Engineered and compared multiple machine learning models to classify maternal health risk levels based on physiological data.  
   - Validated the performance of SGD, Random Forest, and Neural Network classifiers to identify the most effective model for early risk detection.
